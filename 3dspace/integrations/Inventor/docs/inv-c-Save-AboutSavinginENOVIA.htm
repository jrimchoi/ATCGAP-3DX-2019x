You must save the designs often to keep the collaborative group informed

Design for Inventor provides several options that affect the behavior
of the Save process. The default settings for these parameters are specified
in the Global preferences which is set by your Integration Administrator.

<h2 class="topictitle2">Attribute Synchronize</h2>

<p>Attribute synchronization ensures that the attributes in the design
file on your computer match the attributes of the associated ENOVIA object.

<span><a name="ix-save::attribute synchronize"> </a></span>
<p>During the design process, you can enter or change attributes or properties
of the design. When you save the design, you want those attributes and
properties to become part of the metadata for the ENOVIA object.</p>
<p>Your Integration Administrator specifies which attributes and properties
can be synchronized. You can synchronize attributes during save using
the Copy Attributes option.</p>
<p>See ENOVIA Designer Central Installation and Administrator's Guide
for details on attributes that are mapped, mapping attributes, and enforcing
attribute synchronization.</p>
<p>You can also synchronize attributes when you open a design from ENOVIA.</p>

<p>Locking designs in ENOVIA ensures that no other user can modify the
designs you are working on.
<p> Lock status of a design indicates whether
the design that exists in ENOVIA is locked by you or any other user.
The designs in ENOVIA Save dialog box can be selected for saving only
if the designs are not locked by any other user or the design is locked
by you.</p>
<p>Lock status is valid only for designs that exist in ENOVIA vault.
Lock status is not displayed when you save the designs the first time.<span><a name="ix-save::lock status"> </a><a name="ix-lock status::save"> </a></span></p>
<p>ENOVIA Collaboration for Inventor provides a Retain Lock option while
saving designs. By selecting the Retain Lock option during a save the
lock is maintained by the user so that subsequent edits and saves may
be performed.</p>
<p>Applying a Lock indicates the intent to modify the design.</p>

<p>Revision is a controlled release of a design that replaces previous
releases.

<p>Each release is usually identified by an associated letter
code, termed the "revision level" or simply "revision". The purpose of
revisioning is to maintain the history of a design in order to be able
to return to a previous release at any point in time.<span><a name="ix-save::new revision"> </a><a name="ix-new revision::save"> </a></span></p>
<p>Using ENOVIA Collaborative Design for Inventor you can create new
revision stream while saving designs using right-click on selected designs
in the ENOVIA Save dialog box. The new revision stream that is created
is next in sequence to the current stream.</p>

<p>Any design is considered Obsolete if a newer design exists in the ENOVIA
database.


<p><span><a name="ix-obsolete designs::save"> </a><a name="ix-save::obsolete designs"> </a></span>Your design is considered obsolete because it is based on an earlier
design than the latest design in ENOVIA. To resolve obsolete designs
and continue working with the previous version, you can update your designs
in your local workspace using Designer Central Client. See Working with
ENOVIA Designer Central Client section of ENOVIA Designer Central User's
Guide for details on updating designs from local workspace folders.</p>
<p>For example, a design has been stored with multiple versions: 1 &amp;
2 in ENOVIA databse. User A opens version 1 wanting to ignore the modifications
made in V2. When User A tries to save version 1, the design is displayed
as obsolete in ENOVIA Save dialog box.</p>

<p>In an effort to expose the CAD designs to the engineering community
as early as possible, ENOVIA Collaborative Design for Inventor provides
an optional setting that will automatically create an ENOVIA Engineering
Central part and associate it to the CAD model during a Save operation.
The engineering part created will have the same name as the CAD model.


<p><span><a name="ix-save::part association"> </a><a name="ix-part association::save"> </a></span></p>
<p>To enable this, settings must be made in Global Preferences by the
 Integration Administrator. See ENOVIA Designer Central Installation
and Administrator's Guide for details on these settings.</p>

<p>EBOM Synchronization feature provides a tool to automatically generate
the EBOM structure to match the CAD model/assembly structure.
<span><a name="ix-EBOM Synch::save"> </a><a name="ix-save::EBOM Synch"> </a></span><p> During
this process all mapped attributes are also transfered to the engineering
parts. In addition the  CAD models are directly associated to the engineering
parts as CAD specifications allowing engineers direct access to the supporting
CAD model data.</p>
<p>This must be configured by the Integration Administrator. For more
details on the required settings, see "Configuring the EBOM Configuration
Object" section in ENOVIA Collaborative Design for Inventor Administrator's
Guide.</p>

<p>If you are saving an assembly which has one or more participating custom
iParts, then for all participating custom iParts , the file names that
are provided at the time of file generation and the current locations
are used.


<p>For iParts that are not placed in any assembly which is being saved,
the default file names as provided by Inventor is used. The iPartFactory
files also use these default filenames and the root folder is sent as
the location.</p>
<p>If another user tries to use this iPartFactory in any other assembly
and provides another file name, then a warning message that the file
already exists is displayed. </p>
<p>Each time the user ignores the warning to choose the existing filename
and chooses a file name other than already existing one, then the file
is considered as a new iPart created in the parent iPartFactory. </p>
<p>The Save behaviour for custom iParts is undefined if the iPartFactory
attribute ["CustomiPartFileNames"] to track filenames is modified by
the user.</p>
