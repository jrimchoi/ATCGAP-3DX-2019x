On Microsoft Windows platforms, the JDK includes both the Java HotSpot Server VM and Java HotSpot Client VM. However, the J2SE Runtime Environment for Microsoft Windows platforms includes only the Java HotSpot Client VM.

Software vendors may redistribute the Java HotSpot Server VM with their redistributions of the J2SE Runtime Environment.

Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism
</p>
<a name="wp478054"> </a><p style="text-transform: none" class="pBody">
An endorsed standard is a Java API defined through a standards process other than the Java Community ProcessSM (JCPSM). Because endorsed standards are defined outside the JCP, it is anticipated that such standards will be revised between releases of the Java 2 Platform. In order to take advantage of new revisions to endorsed standards, developers and software vendors may use the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism to provide newer versions of an endorsed standard than those included in the Java 2 Platform as released by Sun Microsystems. 
</p>
<a name="wp478055"> </a><p style="text-transform: none" class="pBody">
For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism, including the list of platform packages that it may be used to override, see

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/standards/ 
</p>
<a name="wp478057"> </a><p style="text-transform: none" class="pBody">
Classes in the packages listed on that web page may be replaced only by classes implementing a more recent version of the API as defined by the appropriate standards body. 
</p>
<a name="wp478058"> </a><p style="text-transform: none" class="pBody">
In addition to the packages listed in the document at the above URL, which are part of the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SETM) specification, redistributors of Sun&#39;s J2SE Reference Implementation are allowed to override classes whose sole purpose is to implement the functionality provided by public APIs defined in these Endorsed Standards packages. Redistributors may also override classes in the org.w3c.dom.* packages, or other classes whose sole purpose is to implement these APIs.

Relationship Between the Parties
</p>
<a name="wp478171"> </a><p style="text-transform: none" class="pBody">
The relationship between the end user and MatrixOne and Oracle is that the end user is licensee, MatrixOne is distributor/licensor and Oracle is licensor.  No party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of any other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit any party&#39;s right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party&#39;s products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.

Open Source
</p>
<a name="wp478173"> </a><p style="text-transform: none" class="pBody">
&quot;Open Source&quot; software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user&#39;s modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user &#39;combines&#39; with the Open Source software freely available in source code form.  If you as end user use Open Source software in conjunction with the Programs, you must ensure that your use does not:  (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of MatrixOne or Oracle with respect to the Oracle Programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle Programs.  For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle Program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle Program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any &quot;modifications&quot; be made freely available.  You also may not combine the Oracle Program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License (&quot;GPL&quot;) in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle Program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.
