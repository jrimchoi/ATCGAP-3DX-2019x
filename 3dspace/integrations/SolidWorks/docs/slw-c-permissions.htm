    <p>The administrator may assign you additional permissions.</p><p>For example, a group of   Design Engineers  can be given access to models for their projects, but not for other projects.</p>
  <p>The administrator can define the  security context for the  specific users by assigning  Roles, Projects, and Organizations.  If the users' security context matches an object's security context, the users have access to that object.</p><p>In addition, the administrator can assign a security context to a  policy that is associated with an object to determine who has access to the  object in specific lifecycle states.</p></div>
