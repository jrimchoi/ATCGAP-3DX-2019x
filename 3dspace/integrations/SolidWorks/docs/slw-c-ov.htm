			<p>ENOVIA Collaborative Design for SolidWorks provides a multi-site
SolidWorks design data management solution for the extended
enterprise. It enables designers to access and share each other's
designs from within the native SolidWorks user interface by
using the design team collaboration capabilities of ENOVIA
Designer Central.</p>
<p>
ENOVIA Collaborative Design for SolidWorks provides access to ENOVIA
capabilities within the SolidWorks user interface, enabling  designers
to access, manage, share, and store CAD design data
effortlessly, without leaving their preferred environment. ENOVIA Collaborative
Design for SolidWorks facilitates process workflow, increases data
integrity, and improves configuration management.</p>
<p>From within ENOVIA Collaborative Design for SolidWorks, you
connect to the database using Designer Central's predefined access setup. You can get and check out designs and associated drawings to your local drives. After you make your desired
modifications, you use ENOVIA
Designer Central to store changes in the ENOVIA database by releasing and checking the files back in.</p>
